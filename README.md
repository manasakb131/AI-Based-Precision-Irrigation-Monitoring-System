# AI-Based-Precision-Irrigation-Monitoring-System

# Why This Project?

Water scarcity and inefficient irrigation are major challenges in modern agriculture. Most farmers still rely on fixed schedules or intuition, leading to water wastage, crop stress, and yield loss.

- This project solves that problem using explainable AI — not automation, but intelligent assistance.

# What Does This System Do?

The AI-Assisted Precision Irrigation Monitoring System is an agentic AI–powered decision support platform that helps farmers make smarter irrigation decisions by analyzing:

- Real-time weather data

- Soil moisture conditions

- Crop type and growth stage

- Best-practice irrigation guidelines (via RAG)

Instead of controlling irrigation systems automatically, it provides clear, explainable recommendations so farmers stay in control.

# Key Features

- Early detection of under-irrigation & over-irrigation risks
- Multi-agent AI reasoning for structured decision-making
- Explainable AI recommendations (no black-box decisions)
- Cloud-based & mobile-friendly
- Low-cost and scalable for real-world adoption

# Problem We Address

- Water wastage due to fixed irrigation schedules
- Late detection of crop water stress
- No integration of soil, weather, and crop data
- Low trust in fully automated irrigation systems
- Our Solution

# Using IBM watsonx.ai, IBM Granite foundation models, and LangFlow, this system:

Collects real-time environmental data

Uses AI agents to analyze irrigation risks

Applies RAG to fetch trusted irrigation guidelines

Generates human-readable, explainable advisories
